# League of Poro's Esports Capsule Farmer
## The original one is discontinued, and I may not and cannot fix any bug.
This is the fork of EsportsCapsuleFarmer. I modified the code so that it can run on Linux without GUI. 
I can't guarantee that using this farmer instead of CapsuleFarmerEvolved can pass the shadowban. But if you haven't got shadowban, CapsuleFarmerEvolved is more likely to get detected.

Usage:
1. Install the latest Chrome/Chromium release into /usr/bin/.
2. Install the correct [ChromeDriver release](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) into /usr/bin/.
3. Install dependencies using pip.
4. run python main.py.
